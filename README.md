## Hi, I'm Ruthie (@Ruthie-FRC)

If you're a student or an FRC mentor and have questions about my code, feel free to reach out.

I'm a programmer for **FRC 6243 Energy NERDs**.

### Interests

* Programming
* Research
* Data analytics
* Reading
* Statistics
* Engineering
* Etymology
* Whatever my current ADHD hyperfocus is
* Complex geospatial reasoning and logic
* Independent mathematical research (formulating and proving original theorems)
* Developing new equations for previously intractable problems
* Geometry
* Reading research papers
* Overcomplicating things
* Explaining concepts so badly that the resulting misinterpretations accidentally help me prove conjectures
* ✨ Shenanigans ✨

### Current Project

**Bayesian Optimization–based coefficient autotuner**
(A full implementation, actively being improved.)

### Other Work

Some projects are currently private...for now...

Others are in progress

Some may be sentient...

### Fun Facts

* I'm a research intern
* I absolutely meant to finish this README
* I did not
* I wrote more BayesOpt code instead

## Notes

**Temporary Repository Privacy**

Some open-source repositories are currently private due to unresolved issues regarding legal crediting. For my protection, they will remain private until:

1. Proper licensing is added
2. The crediting issue is resolved
3. Each project reaches a usable v1 state

Thank you for your patience. If you're one of the organizations who reached out, I’m still actively developing (or awaiting instruction to start work on) your version of the 
software and am happy to continue collaborating.
