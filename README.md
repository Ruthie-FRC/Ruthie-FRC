# Notes

**I apologize for the temporary private status of my open source repos. 
 To everyone who has contacted me regarding them, I have not abandoned them.
 However, I am experiencing issues regarding legal crediting issues.
 Therefore, for my protection, they will be made private until:**
1. I add liscense to them
2. The issue is resolved
3. They are in at least a v1 stopping point and are usable, if not fully fleshed out.

**I appreciate the understanding, and if you are one of the organizations who have expressed interest, I am more than happy to continue to work on your version of the software**
