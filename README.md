## Hi. I'm Ruthie. (@Ruthie-FRC)

If you are a student or FRC mentor and have any questions about my code, feel free to reach out!

I'm a programmer for the 6243 Energy NERDs.
My hobbies include:
- programming
- research
- data analytics
- not getting enough sleep at night
- drinking tea
- reading
- statistics
- engineering
- etymology 
- whatever my current adhd hyperfixation is!
- complex geospatial reasoning and logic
- Independent mathematical research (formulating and proving original theorems)
- Developing new equations to model and predict problems previously considered too complex
- geometry
- reading research papers
- explaining ideas/concepts so poorly that the products of their misinterpertations
  somehow help me prove my origional conjectures by accident
- ✨Shenanigans✨

My current passion project:
Implementing Bayesian Optimization for a coefficident autotuner
Some stuff thats secret... for now... 

Fun facts: 
- I'm a research intern
- I was too lazy to finish my profile README.md
- So I did not
- Instead I worked on more bayesopt
- bye!

TODOS:
-----------
- 5892/Sidekick #5 - in progress 🟨

- 5892/Sidekick #10 - not started 🟥
- more bayesopt! - done for now 🟩*
- anti tipping - not started 🟥

*there is no such thing as too much bayesopt, hence it is never truly done.
