## Hi, I'm Ruthie (@Ruthie-FRC)

If you're a student or an FRC mentor and have questions about my code, feel free to reach out.

I'm a programmer for **FRC 6243 Energy NERDs**.

### Interests

* Programming
* Research
* Data analytics
* Reading
* Statistics
* Engineering
* Etymology
* Whatever my current ADHD hyperfocus is
* Complex geospatial reasoning and logic
* Independent mathematical research (formulating and proving original theorems)
* Developing new equations for previously intractable problems
* Geometry
* Reading research papers
* Overcomplicating things
* Explaining concepts so badly that the resulting misinterpretations accidentally help me prove conjectures
* ✨ Shenanigans ✨

### Current Project

**Bayesian Optimization–based coefficient autotuner**
(A full, FRC-centric implementation, actively being improved.
Feel free to reach out to me about creating non FRC versions!)

### Other Work

Some projects are currently private...for now...

Others are in progress

Some may be sentient...

### Fun Facts

* I'm a research intern
* I absolutely meant to finish this README
* I did not
* I wrote more BayesOpt code instead
